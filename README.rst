Cardano Serialization Lib
=========================

This is a library for serialization & deserialization of data structures
used in Cardano’s Haskell implementation of Shelley along with useful
utility functions.

How can I use this library
--------------------------

Rust is wonderfully portable! You can easily bind to the native Rust
library from any common programming language (even C and WebAssembly)!

NPM packages
''''''''''''

-  `NodeJS WASM package`_
-  `Browser (chrome/firefox) WASM package`_

Mobile bindings
'''''''''''''''

-  `React-Native mobile bindings`_

Benefits of using this library
------------------------------

Serialization/deserialization code is automatically generated from
Cardano’s official specification, which guarantees it can easily stay up
to date! We do this using an EMURGO-written tool called `cddl-codegen`_
which can be re-used for other tasks such as automatically generate a
Rust library for Cardano metadata specifications!

It is also very easy to create scripts in Rust or WASM to share with
stake pools, or even embed inside an online tool! No more crazy
cardano-cli bash scripts!

Powerful and flexible enough to be used to power wallets and exchanges!
(Yes, it’s used in production!)

Documentation
-------------

This library generates both `Typescript`_ and `Flow`_ type definitions,
so it’s often easiest to see what is possible by just looking at the
types! You can find the Flow types `here`_

You can also look in the `example`_ folder to see how to use this
library from Typescript or just experiment with the library.

What about other versions of Cardano?
-------------------------------------

If you are looking for legacy bindings, you can find them at the
following:

-  `Byron WASM bindings`_
-  `Jormungandr WASM bindings`_

Building
--------

If you need to install Rust, do the following:

::

   curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
   echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin/:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV
   rustup default nightly
   rustup update
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
   curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

To build this repository, do the following:

::

   git submodule update --init --recursive
   nvm use
   npm install
   npm run rust:build-nodejs

Testing
-------

::

   npm run rust:test
