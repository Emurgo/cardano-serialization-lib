# Pre-requisite knowledge

This library assumes a certain amount of knowledge about how Cardano works (want to avoid re-documenting the wheel).

You can find the specifications of Cardano's ledger [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs) which we suggest consulting as you use this library. Notably, the `Shelley ledger formal specification` covers the core concepts.
