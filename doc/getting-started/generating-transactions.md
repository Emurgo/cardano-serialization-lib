# Generating Transactions

To mention:

1) TransactionBuilder interface
2) Why fee calculation differs in Rust vs Haskell
3) Change address calculation

Need to tell people to refer to the spec for:

1) Transactions need to be balance (any extra ADA has to be burned in fees)
2) Which witnesses are required
3) Rules for withdrawals
4) Rules for deregistration
